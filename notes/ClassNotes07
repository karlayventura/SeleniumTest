* Selenium Class 7

* Handling multiple windows(tabs):
  - In order to handle multiple windows we will be using:
    2 Methods = getWindowHandle();
                getWindowHandles();

* WindowHandle:
  - A unique ID that holds the address of the window or tab
  - It is approximately a 40 alphanumeric character ID.

* Synchronization:
  - Is the process of bringing the speed of 2 or more components to the same level.
  - In this case we are bringing out script & page load to the same speed level.

* Thread.sleep() = Static wait or unconditional wait. (

* Types of selenium waits:
  1. Implicit wait
  2. Explicit wait
  3. Fluent wait

* Implicit Wait:
  - Tells the web driver to wait for a certain amount of time before throwing an exception
  - Only written 1 time & will be applied to the whole session of the execution.
  - We can say that implicit wait is a global wait.


* Implicit wait works with:
  - findElement(); method.
  - Waits for elements to be found.

* Implicit wait time:
  ~ Is usually set to 20 secs.
  ~ If your element is found in any time between the given time
    the remaining time will be ignored & your script will move on to the next line or action.

  ~ if element is not found in given time, Only then you will get an exception.
