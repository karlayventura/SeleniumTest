* Selenium Class 2

* What is a WebElement ?
- Anything we see on the web page is considered to be a WebElement
- e.g buttons, textboxes, checkboxes, links

* What is HTML ?
- Stands for Hyper text mark language
- USED for web paged only

* What is DOM ? (right click & inspect)
- Stands for Document Object Model
- It is the browser's internal view of the webpage.
- Also called as developer's tools or dev tools
----- BREAKDOWN OF DOM -----
* Document = Can be stored any document such as pdf, excel etc
* Object = Any line in HTML is considered as object
* Model = It is just a layout of the HTML

* What is a Locator ?
- Is an address or a position of an WebElement on the web page.
- Is used to locate or identify WebElement on the web page.

* 8 locators :
1) ID
2) Name
3) TagName
4) Xpath
5) LinkText
6) PartialLinkText
7) CSS Selector
8) ClassName

* HTML Scripting Meaning
- Purple: Tags (button, input, div)
- Brown: Attributes (name,class,id) * Also a locator *
- Blue: Attribute values
- <a = link

* Why do we need many locators ?
- Developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
- Some locators may have duplicate values in different nodes
- Some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for
e.g linkText & partialLinkText are only used for links

* "a" tag is also called an anchor tag

* If 2 or more elements have same attributes & attribute values,
  Selenium will only interact with the 1st element it locates
