- Works with different browsers & supports cross browsing testing
- Works with different programming languages = Java, JavaScript, Ruby, Python
- OS independent = iOS, Windows, Linux

* Disadvantages of Selenium WebDriver :
- Cannot test desktop applications
- No technical support
- No built in reports
- Cannot test captchas(are you a robot, verify the traffic light), images or videos

* get() VS navigate() :
- navigate() = Can go back & forward & refresh
- get() = Will wait for the page to fully load
- navigate() = will not wait for the page to fully load
- get() = will NOT keep the history of the browser
- navigate() = will keep the history of browser

* close() VS quit() :
- close() = will close the current tab
- quit() = will quit the whole browser

* fullscreen() VS maximize() :
- maximize() = will maximize the browser & will be able to see the control panel (back & forward, bookmarks)
- fullscreen() = will maximize the whole application
