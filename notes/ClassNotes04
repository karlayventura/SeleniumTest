* Selenium Class 4

* CSS Selector: (Cascading style sheet )
- Another way of locating elements on the web page.

* SYNTAX: tagName[attribute = 'attribute value']
* EXAMPLE: button[type = 'submit']

* RULES:
- Does not allow you to locate the element by it's text.

***** Shortcuts for CSS *****

- ClassName: "." (period)
* SYNTAX: tagname.classNameValue
* EXAMPLE: input.button

- ID: "#" (hash)
* SYNTAX: tagname#IDValue
* EXAMPLE: input#twotabsearchtextbox

***** Identify elements using CSS Selector *****

- Contains() method in css:
* "*" (star) symbol represents contains method
* SYNTAX: tagname[attribute *= 'attribute value']
* EXAMPLE: input[placeholder *= 'Email']

- Starts-with method in css:
* "^" (circumflex) symbol represents starts with method.
* SYNTAX: tagname[attribute ^= 'starting attribute value']
* EXAMPLE: input[type ^= 'pass']

- Ends-with method in css:
* "$" (dollar sign) symbol represents starts with method.
* SYNTAX: tagname[attribute $= 'ending attribute value']
* EXAMPLE: img[src $= 'syntax.png']

*** XPATH VS CSS ***
- CSS: cannot locate the elements by text    - XPATH: you can located elements by text
- CSS: has ends-with method                  - XPATH: does not have ends-with method
- CSS: is faster at finding elements         - XPATH: is slower at finding elements
- CSS: has shortcuts                         - XPATH: does not have shortcuts
- CSS: has no advantages                     - XPATH: does have advantages using parent,child,sibling relationship
- CSS: has more simple syntax                - XPATH: has more difficult syntax

*** WebElement Commands:
- Consists of several methods where we can perform an action & get the element state on the webpage.

- isEnable() : boolean value
- isDisplayed() : boolean value
- isSelected() : boolean value
- clear() : void
- getText() : String value
